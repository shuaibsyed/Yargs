# Public test 2 (public02)
#
# Runs yargs.x with the -n option and a target program, no target arguments,
# and some standard input.  This should produce output because the commands
# will be printed, but not executed.  yargs.x should have an exit status of
# zero.
#
# If you want to debug your code for this test, run gdb yargs.x.  Then
# (perhaps after setting some breakpoints), in gdb, use the command:
#
#   run -n ls < public02+03.inputdata
#
# (c) Larry Herman, 2023.  You are allowed to use this code yourself, but
# not to provide it to anyone else.

./yargs.x -n ls < public02+03.inputdata

if ($status != 0) then
  # error exit
  echo "Problem!  yargs.x did not exit with status 0 in the first run."
  exit 9
endif
